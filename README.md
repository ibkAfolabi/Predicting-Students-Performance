# Predicting-Students-Performance

Description of Project
----------------------
To predict the performance (graduation cgpa) of students (for recommending which students to admit and also for academic level Advising) using data containing biodata, pre admission requirements/ results and performance in the university. The first stage is the descriptive analysis using different visualization tools such as the bar charts, box plots, histograms and so on and finally using regression analysis to describe the relationship between the data attributes. The second stage is to predict the  result of a particular student (s) based on some given  criteria. The purpose of this is to determine for example, which student to admit, and also advise the student against bad academic performance.  The data used for this purpose comprises of all students that has ever graduated from the department of Computer Science, Covenant University (ie from 2005/2006 to 2017/2018). The record totals 991
Methodology

Multiple Linear Regression is chosen for this prediction assignment due to numeric nature of the data and its ability to give high prediction accuracy with less than 1000 records (Shmueli et al., 2018)
